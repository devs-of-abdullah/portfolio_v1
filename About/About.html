    <h2>About</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> i have a strong programming foundation that makes me learn any language,tool... in no time </p>
    <br>
 <p>My main focus is <b> backend development and databases,</b> but I also like working with  <b>frontend frameworks.</b> </p> 
<br>

<p> I always write clean, maintaible well structured code, cause I believe every project is just like a lego,build break by break </p>
<br>
<p> open to internship and part-time job opportunities, where I can improve my skills, work with a team, and earn real-world experience</p>
